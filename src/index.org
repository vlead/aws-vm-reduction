* Introduction 
  This will contain the documentation related to the activities for 
  experiment as a service. 

* Approach A
** Steps
  + Identify the labs whose experiments are to be clubbed togther.
  + Deploy a =experiment server=, which will contain the clubbed
    experiments.
  + Copy the source code of =lab1= in =experiment server= such that
    sources are at /var/www/html/lab1/
  + Copy the source code of =lab2= in =experiment server= such that
    sources are at /var/www/html/lab2/
  + Visit the lab and then specific experiments, identify the file
    serving the Simulation (say Simulation.html)
  + Say experiment is served at URL http://lab1/exp1/Simulation.html and http://lab2/exp1/Simulation.html
  + Try to access the same experiment from experiment server (say
    http://experiment-server/lab1/exp1/Simulation.html)
  + Similiarly, try to access ( say
    http://experiment-server/lab2/exp1/Simulation.html)
  + Make changes in reverse-proxy server to redirect
    http://lab1/exp1/Simulation.html to
    http://experiment-server/lab1/Simulation.html
** Issues 
  + Lab sources with relative and absolute paths are to be checked for
    link integrity. Change in DicrectoryRoot will make assets like
    images, js, css unaccessble and hence will not load.
  + Adding entries in Reverse proxy server to redirect old urls to new
    urls need multiple rules for file to file redirection.
